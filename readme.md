## Introduction and Install

GroupThink is a package designed to assist in the analysis in
categorical survey data. It mainly acts as an interface for existing
`tidyverse` functions - but makes it easier to aggregate responses, do
cross-question analysis, and avoid classic mistakes typical of survey
data analysis.

It currently has two functions:`unify()` and `assess()` (though others
are planned for the future…!).

GroupThink isn’t on CRAN, so you’ll need to use `devtools` to install
it. Run:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

devtools::install_github("Sam-Osian/GroupThink")
library(GroupThink)
```

As GroupThink is still in development, you should periodically reinstall
the package to get updates.  

&nbsp;  

### Dependencies

GroupThink depends on `dplyr`, `tidyr` and `gt` libraries. If these
aren’t installed automatically when you install GroupThink, you may need
to run:

``` r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "gt"))
```

&nbsp;  

## Benefits of GroupThink

GroupThink is a response to key bottlenecks and common mistakes when
analysing survey data. The function is beneficial because it…

- **Allows for easy groupings.** `unify()` makes it very easy to group
  together different Likert-style responses (e.g. combining
  `Somewhat agree` with `Strongly agree`, or `Excellent` and
  `Very good`). It’s now extremely difficult to make mistakes with
  incorrect groupings, as `unify()` alerts you of any unassigned
  responses.

- **Automates your calculations.** `unify()` handles n and proportion
  calculations for you, meaning you no longer have to undertake complex
  data manipulation tasks, avoiding functions such as `pivot_longer()`,
  which can result in inaccurate figures if you’re not careful!

- **Works with full questions as column headers.** Typically, exporting
  survey responses (such as from Microsoft Forms or SurveyMonkey) will
  leave you with full questions (e.g. “Do you agree or disagree that…”)
  as column headers. This is usually a nightmare to work with in R.
  Because `unify()` works on column indexes, rather than column names,
  you don’t need to worry about recoding your columns or typing out full
  survey questions throughout your code.

- **Gives usable outputs.**. `unify()` neatly integrates with ggplot,
  allowing you to visualise your aggregated data. Alternatively, you can
  produce formatted tables through the gtTable argument.

- **Presents clear, readable syntax.** Even for those unfamiliar with R
  syntax, `unify()` makes it very clear exactly how you’ve grouped
  together your responses, improving readability and reproducibility.

- **Means faster insights.** With just a few lines of code, this
  function could save you hours worth of work for large survey projects.

&nbsp;  


## Core functionality

### The `unify()` function

The `unify()` function groups together Likert-style responses for a
given question or set of questions, returning a summarised output that
contains the n and proportion for each of these groupings.

``` r
unify(data, cols = 1, # ...dataframe name and column index number(s) to analyse
      
      # Below, we 'group' responses via custom grouping labels (e.g. 'Agree'):
      Agree = c("Somewhat agree", "Strongly agree"),
      Disagree = c("Somewhat disagree", "Strongly disagree"),
      Neutral = "Neither agree nor disagree",

      ignore = "Don't know") # ...optionally, set response(s) to ignore from calcs
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 7
    ##   Question         `Agree (n)` `Disagree (n)` `Neutral (n)` `Agree (Proportion)`
    ##   <chr>                  <int>          <int>         <int>                <dbl>
    ## 1 I find the cour…          38             32            18                 43.2
    ## # ℹ 2 more variables: `Disagree (Proportion)` <dbl>,
    ## #   `Neutral (Proportion)` <dbl>

The grouping labels can be anything you like. For example, `Agree` could
instead be `Positive`, `Good`, `Satisifed` or something else entirely.
Similarly, `Don't know` could be its own group, instead of being
ignored. You may include as many grouping labels as you’d like.

There’s of course nothing wrong with having just 1 response option per
group (e.g. `"Somewhat agree" = "Somewhat agree"`). The main purpose of
`unify()` is that it forces you to be **intentional** with how you
handle your data, to improve consistency and avoid mistakes.  
&nbsp;  

### Left out responses

If you forgot to include a response in your custom groupings, `unify()`
will throw an error. This is crucial for avoiding mistakes in your
proportion calculations. For example:

``` r
unify(data, 1, Agree = "Somewhat agree",
                #"Strongly agree"), -- let's stop unify() from seeing this line
      Disagree = c("Somewhat disagree", "Strongly disagree"),
      Neutral = "Neither agree nor disagree",
      ignore = "Don't know") 
```

    ## Error in unify(data, 1, Agree = "Somewhat agree", Disagree = c("Somewhat disagree", : The following responses are not accounted for in the provided groups: 'Strongly agree'. Please check your grouping arguments.

As seen above, the output tells you that you forgot to assign “Strongly
agree” to a grouping variable.

These errors are crucial, since other R functions do not warn you if you
haven’t accounted for a group, or mistyped “Strongly **A**gree”, as
“Strongly **a**gree”, for example.  
&nbsp;  


### Data for unify()

The `unify()` function expects data that looks like this:

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 3
    ##    I find the course material en…¹ The course workload …² Feedback from assign…³
    ##    <fct>                           <fct>                  <fct>                 
    ##  1 Somewhat disagree               Agree                  Disagree              
    ##  2 Strongly agree                  Disagree               No opinion            
    ##  3 Somewhat agree                  Agree                  <NA>                  
    ##  4 Somewhat disagree               Unsure                 Disagree              
    ##  5 Somewhat agree                  <NA>                   Strongly agree        
    ##  6 Strongly agree                  Neither agree nor dis… <NA>                  
    ##  7 Strongly disagree               Neither agree nor dis… Strongly agree        
    ##  8 Somewhat agree                  Highly disagree        Strongly agree        
    ##  9 Somewhat disagree               Neither agree nor dis… Strongly disagree     
    ## 10 Somewhat agree                  Neither agree nor dis… Agree                 
    ## # ℹ abbreviated names: ¹​`I find the course material engaging and relevant.`,
    ## #   ²​`The course workload is manageable within my schedule.`,
    ## #   ³​`Feedback from assignments is helpful for my learning.`

Responses do not need to be consistently labelled either within or
between different questions/columns, and can contain missing data
(you’ll likely want to assign `NA` to the ignore parameter).  
&nbsp;  


### View column index numbers

Since GroupThink functions work with column **index numbers**, not
column names, you’ll likely want to summarise all index numbers of your
dataset. For this, run `colnames()` from base-R.

``` r
colnames(data)
```

    ## [1] "I find the course material engaging and relevant."    
    ## [2] "The course workload is manageable within my schedule."
    ## [3] "Feedback from assignments is helpful for my learning."
&nbsp;  


### The `assess()` function

You might find it beneficial to run GroupThink’s `assess()` function,
which provides an overview of the different response options in your
specified columns.

``` r
assess(data, cols = c(2, 3))
```

    ## Examining the following columns:
    ## 
    ## Column [2]: The course workload is manageable within my schedule.
    ## Column [3]: Feedback from assignments is helpful for my learning.
    ## 
    ## 
    ## 11 unique responses were found across these columns. Please make sure each response
    ## below is accounted for within your `unify()` function call:
    ## 
    ## 
    ## Agree
    ## Disagree
    ## Highly agree
    ## Highly disagree
    ## Indifferent
    ## Neither agree nor disagree
    ## No opinion
    ## Strongly agree
    ## Strongly disagree
    ## Unsure
    ## NA
&nbsp;  


## Further functionality

#### Aggregate across multiple columns/questions

You are not restricted to analysing just one question/column with
`unify()`. You can specify multiple columns/questions to use for the
output:

``` r
unify(data, c(1, 2, 3), # ...analyse Columns 1, 2 and 3
      Positive = c("Somewhat agree", "Strongly agree", "Highly agree", "Agree"),
      Negative = c("Somewhat disagree", "Strongly disagree", "Highly disagree",
                   "Disagree"),
      ignore = c(NA, "Don't know", "Unsure", "Neither agree nor disagree",
                 "No opinion", "Indifferent"),
      
      hideN = TRUE) # ...(optional) hide n column from output (a lot cleaner!)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 3
    ##   Question                         Positive (Proportion…¹ Negative (Proportion…²
    ##   <chr>                                             <dbl>                  <dbl>
    ## 1 Feedback from assignments is he…                   57.8                   42.2
    ## 2 I find the course material enga…                   54.3                   45.7
    ## 3 The course workload is manageab…                   36.7                   63.3
    ## # ℹ abbreviated names: ¹​`Positive (Proportion)`, ²​`Negative (Proportion)`

…Just make sure that you’ve accounted for each response option across
your range of columns, otherwise you’ll get an error.  

&nbsp;  

#### Make formatted tables

Using the gtTable argument, `unify()` makes it simple to create nice,
formatted tables.

``` r
unify(data, 1, Agree = c("Somewhat agree", "Strongly agree"),
      Disagree = c("Somewhat disagree", "Strongly disagree"),
      Neutral = "Neither agree nor disagree",
      ignore = "Don't know",
      filter = c("Agree", "Disagree"),
      hideN = TRUE, # ...optionally, hide N column
      
      gtTable = TRUE) # ...set gtTable to TRUE
```

Question | Agree (Proportion) | Disagree (Proportion)
--- | --- | ---
I find the course material engaging and relevant. | 43.2 | 36.4

&nbsp;  
  
#### Filter out responses from the output only

If you want to only display one response option in the output, we can
use the `filter` argument.

Note that this is different from the `ignore` parameter: `filter`
removes unwanted responses *after* the calculations have been performed,
while `ignore` removes them *before*.

``` r
unify(data, 3,
      Agree = c("Agree", "Strongly agree"),
      Disagree = c("Disagree", "Strongly disagree"),
      Neither = c("No opinion", "Indifferent"),
      ignore = c(NA, "Don't know"),
      
      filter = "Agree") # ...only include the Agree group in the output
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   Question                                      `Agree (n)` `Agree (Proportion)`
    ##   <chr>                                               <int>                <dbl>
    ## 1 Feedback from assignments is helpful for my …          37                 38.9

The other variable groupings are used for the calculations, but only
“Agree” responses are shown in the final output.  

&nbsp;  

#### Integrate with ggplot

Unless you’ve set `unify()`’s gtTable() argument to `TRUE`, it will
output as a tibble. This means it integrates neatly into `ggplot()`
function calls.

Let’s pretend we’ve already run `unify()` on columns 1, 2 & 3, and
assigned it to the name `united`…  

``` r
ggplot(data = united, # ...unify() output becomes ggplot()'s data argument
       aes(x = Question, y = `Agree (Proportion)`, fill = Question)) +
  geom_col() +
  
  # ...below are just optional customisation options:
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("cornflowerblue", "coral", "chartreuse3")) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 70)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Even more functionality

For other functionality not covered in this document, please run
`?unify()` and `?assess()` to view the help files, which covers all
function parameters.  

&nbsp;  

## Future plans

-  Add `unify()` support for demographic comparison (comparing figures between factors such as age, sex, etc.)

-  Add support for `stargazer` tables into `unify()`.

-  Develop a separate function for analysing multiple choice data for
  data formats typical of exported survey data.
